      added NDIR CO2 Sensor MH-Z19 plugin to TESTING plugin set
      remove artificial sensor startup delays. (now all sensors are send immediatly after booting and wifi-connecting)

      enable status light as soon as wifi is connected
      use sizeof instead of magic numbers
      Implemented speaker and tone functions from https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=343&hilit=speaker&start=10
      enabled Arduino OTA for dev-firmware only, to ease developing. minor output-tweaks
      cold boot startup delay
